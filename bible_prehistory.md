#title The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future

# Early historical factors, location, interests

Why was the bible produced at the time it was produced, and by the relatively small and powerless people of Canaan instead of the great civilizations around it like Assyrians or Egyptians?

At the beginning, there was water. A steady, abundant and predictable water supply allowed the great civilizations to prosper: Egypt by the Nile, the Babylonians by the tigris and euphrates.

Israel and Judah, the region of the levant the bible refers to as Canaan, is a *land bridge* between the great civilizations of Assyria in the north and Egypt in the south. 

The brief times of consolidation of power into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, correspond to the historical periods where Egypt/Babylonia were concentrated elsewhere and lesss powerful in their borders. The periods of oppression experienced by the jewish people corresponded to the times of assertiveness by the big powers surrounding them.

# Narrative devices in the bible

Some key mechanism are apparent in the construction of the bible: one is *retroactive explanation* and consolidation of history of Israel and Judah into a single lineage. Another is the explanation of fall by *divine retribution*

That consolidation story is mainly achieved through two models, one is family, main device from genesis to kings, and the other militaristic, mainly in exodus.

In the process of retroactive explanation and divine retribution, The bible authors, working from a Judah perspective, explain the fall of Israel by vilifying the Omride dynasty as worshipers of Baal, straying away from  YWHW. In reality the omride dynasty was particularly successful and it was the historical succession 

Omri (875 BCE) → Ahab (of Ahab and Jezebel fame) → Joram

and not the biblical succession of

Saul → David → Solomon

who actually put Israel on the map as a prosperous kingdom.  

Other strategies of the bible include literary emphasis to soften certain realities and make them fit the narrative better. One example is in 2 Kings 3:4-8 where Ahab (Israel) is portrayed as getting voluntary help from Judah when in fact the relationship may have been more that of lord-vassal.

Above all, the main unifying narrative strategy of the bible is divine retribution. The fall of the Omrides, the exile, the destruction of the temples, all are attributed to straying away from  YWHW’s.

# Basic sequence of events in Bible and in History 

The basic sequence in biblical lines is this:

 - Age of patriarchs (Adam, Noah)
 - Exodus and conquest (Moses)
 - Period of Judges
 - United Kingdom (Saul, David, Solomon)
 - Because of Solomon’s faults, divine retribution after his death: break up with Jeroboam in north, Israel. Raboam in south, Judah.
 - Divided Monarchy of Israel and Judah  
 - Because of Ahab (& Jezebel’s) straying away, followed by Yehu’s mass murders, Divine retribution again, fall of Irsrael at the hands of the Babylonians.
 - Judah continues until again, go astray from god and captured by Assyrians.
 - Exile and return (Mordecai, Esther, Ezekiah)
 - "Birth of Judaism" as renewed focus on family and survival after defeat

The basic sequence in Historical terms  of the kingdom of Israel is:

Iron age I: 1200-100: nomadic tribes.
Iron age II: 1000-586: By the end of Iron age I and through Iron age 2 enough accumulation of goods to speak properly of communities consolidating into Israel and Judah
With Egypt concentration of the Aegean, Israel is given room to prosper.
Omride Dynasty in Israel, vassals of Assyrian power. Ahab shown in a famous Assyrian record, the Black Obelisk, presenting tribute to  Shalmeneser III.  This continues until Tiglath Pileser III in 727.
Menachem, king of israel  joins in 732 a coallition agains assyria. Ahaz, king of Judah pays tribute instead. After this Hoshea is installed, probably by Assyrians themselves.
Hoshea attempts rebellion. 
722 Israel falls with help of egypt. After fall 90% of population left behind
Evidence of loss of identity and subjugation to assyrian custom.

The basic sequence of Judah after Israel’s fall is:

The death of Tiglath-pileser III marks the beginning of a strong Judah (727). 
Reign of Hezekiah, period of prosperity and strenghtening
Manasseh succeeds Hezekiah
Pharaoh Necho executed Josiah in 609 BC
Necho appoints Joachim in 609
In 605 Nebuchadnezzar, the babylonian defeats the assyrians
601 Necho stops Nebuchadnezzar inspiring Judah to ally with Egypt
In 597 Nebuchadnezzar attacks jerusalem, deposes  Joachim and puts in Zedekiah
10 years later, in 586,  Zedekiah tries to revolt. He is unsucessful and his eyes are gouged out. 

If the biblical recurrent pattern is divine retribution, the historical counterpart is accumulation of wealth in the proportion permitted by weakness of the larger powers, followed by unsuccessful revolt and subjugation.  

# The bible as response to defeat

The main thesis of the class is the bible as a fundamental work of literature, made for political social and theological unification. Unique in that it was produced by a small and relatively weak people in face of defeat, to establish a common background, a unique god, and a law which would serve as popular continuity even without a king and in the diaspora. 

## Problems with the continuity argument

In a literal reading of the bible or a historical but idealized view, the culture and traditions of the Judahites are only one source and continue throughout the fall of Judah. In reality the conditions of Judahites in the time of the writing of the bible (~586 BCE) seem to have left evidence of serious fragmentation:

 Elephantine Papyri and material culture show that jewish people living in egypt at the time didn’t know Torah and when asking their families in the north, they would point them to assyrian custom, not Torah.
The Judahite life in Babylon is relatively well documented and points to attempts at assimilation not jewish continuity

## The Biblical lineage

TODO: The biblical lineage 


## Reconstruction of text, plurality of sources

One fascinating aspect of critical reading of the bible is the identification of sources. The JEPD tradition (now revised and expanded but still useful to identify plurality) decomposes the text in four sources:
Jawhist: Judah
Elohist: Israel
Priestly: Judah
Deutoronomist: Judah

Basically there is a base text from the 10 C and 6C, which had survived mostly orally and now is being put to paper (not stone) and is being annotated and supplemented by the latter Judahite concerns. 

An example of the JEPD deconstruction is the story of Isaac and Rebekah.  A great deal of time is spent here on describing the friendly interactions with philistines to “prove” or “document” that beersheba is a actually legitimately and historically jewish. To the older narrative many aspects are added, for example in describing Rebekah as the virtuous one and in contrast to others, there’s a big component of Priestly editorial comment on the dangers of mixed marriage.

# Key differentiating aspects in the approach and nature of the bible as community building text

## Reinvention of the hero
Nobility of character, not military virtue take the center stage. Family matters are the key definition of that character. Survival and continuation of family tradition for the good of the community the principal factors.

Where Horace used to say “Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,” the position of the bible is more akin to Bertold Brecht’s famous reply “It is sweeter and more fitting to live for one's country.” Survival, not grandiose death is celebrated.  In fact, those seeking grandiose military deaths in Judges seem to have rather embarrassing or not-so-great deaths. The key example is abimelech who has to ask his page to kill him after  a woman has mortally wounded him with a stone.

Levirate marriage (taking care of your brother’s widow) and exception of military duty for marriage are some of the family-centered rules that deviate from other cultures of antiquity.

## Law is king

The bible is blueprint for the defeated and the diaspora living under other rules, not a king of their own. A key strategy of the bible is to say that does not matter for the Law of the one god is above any mortal ruler. 

For Greeks War, Honor, Laurels. For the Jewish Collective preservation, Family, Procreation.


# Bible as an education curriculum for everyone

Different from previous civilizations where education was for the elites only. Bible is an educational curriculum that gives birth to a nation.

Moses is a pedagogue to the nation. Ezra a second Moses.

The root of this is not a higher egalitarianism between jewish people, but rather the consequence of defeat.  To concentrate on making everyone stronger by knowledge is essential to compete and survive when there is no military power or physical resources.  It is in this sense that the bible can be associated with the term Herrschaftswissen, knowledge that empowers.

## Divination and prophecy

Another interesting difference of the bible from other cultures is the role of divination and prophecy. Where assyrian kings went through great lengths to keep prophecy secret and prophets closely controlled and tied to the throne, the biblical prophetic text distances itself from thrones, has the people as a whole at its scope not just the king, and its audience is everyone.

## Priestly knowledge

Priestly knowledge is kept but now is open to public scrutiny. 

In this context it is interesting to reinterpret Job not as a theodicy, but rather an anthropodicy, a study not on the ways of god which clearly have no answers in the text but a study and exhortation to survival.

There is also a possiblity of reinterpretation of Law not as something more communal than the will of a sovereign enforced by violence as Agamben defines. Whether that is feasible or practical is debatable but readings of the Deutoronomy seem to allow it, at least in the sense of saying the King is under the law too, not its source.

# Final parallels and thoughts

An interesting parallel can be drawn between the bible and the Mesha stele (or the earliest Merneptah stele for that matter): defeat, parchment not stone, an anonymous narrator.

Between the destruction of the first temple on 586 and the destruction of the second temple in 70 BCE the  bible prepared people for another wipe out an life after it. Unlike other religious and legislative codes of the past, the bible has been passed continuously through open access to everyone uninterruptedly since its writing. 

## Emergence of the pan-israelite identity
Primarily through defeat but also:
Long duree: he long natural and geographical factors common to judah and israel.
Political centralization and expansion: although some prophets resent israel the tendency was centralization in Samaria
The role of Judah after the fall is that of continuation of the role of Israel. 
After 586 attempts to find monarchs not successful

The bible can be seen as covenant, not treaty, and not like that of Sinai in Deuteronomy but amongst people. An literature for an internal pact of survival.
